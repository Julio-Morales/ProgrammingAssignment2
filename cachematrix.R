## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

## makeCacheMatrix is a function that creates a special matrix object that
## can cache its inverse.
## We are assuming that matrix is always invertible.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    m <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        m <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setinverse <- function(inverse) m <<- inverse
    getinverse <- function() m
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setinverse = setinverse,
         getinverse = getinverse)
} ## End of makeCacheMatrix


## cacheSolve is a function computes the inverse of the special "matrix"
## returned by makeCacheMatrix. If the inverse has already been 
## calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then cacheSolve should
## retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
    m <- x$getinverse()
    if(!is.null(m)) {
        message("getting cached data")
        return(m)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    m <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setinverse(m)
    m
} ## End of cacheSolve
